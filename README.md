# Animated-Facial-Image-Synthesis-From-Sketches
The face sketch synthesis with image animation can increase the probability of law enforcement and criminal cases to identify and catch suspects.The aim of this project is to implement a neural
network model based on GANs for face photo synthesis from sketches and also combine this image for image animation. To achieve this, a GANs structure network based on pix2pix model is implemented by leveraging the code High-Quality Facial Photo-Sketch Synthesis Using Multi-Adversarial Networks with the combination of pix2pix model codes and trained with CUHK Face Sketch dataset. Furthermore, in the end the output is chosen to be combined with the image animation code which is taken as the implementation of Aliaksandr Siarohin[(https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/firstorder-model.)]. In the end, this approach had SSIM of 0.834 which is better than the outputs got by High-Quality Facial PhotoSketch Synthesis Using Multi-Adversarial Networks which includes basic pix2pix model as well.

You can find detailed implementation in Google Colab link provided.
